## Viewing Booking Requests

Access booking requests from:

- **Admin Dashboard**: Shows pending requests requiring attention (Coming Soon™)
- **Bookings Page**: View all bookings (pending, approved, rejected)
- **Calendar View**: See requests in the context of existing bookings (Coming Soon™)

## Reviewing a Request

When reviewing a booking request, check:

1. **Availability**: Ensure no conflicts with existing bookings
2. **Details**: Verify event information is complete and appropriate
3. **User**: Check the requesting user's booking history
4. **Resources**: Confirm room capacity matches attendee count

## Approving Requests

To approve a booking request:

1. Navigate to the booking request
2. Review all details carefully
3. Click the "Approve" button
4. The user receives an automatic confirmation notification

::callout{icon="i-lucide-info"}
Approved bookings are immediately added to the calendar and the room becomes unavailable for that time slot.
::

## Rejecting Requests

If you need to reject a request:

1. Open the booking request
2. Click the "Reject" button
3. **Provide a reason** for rejection (this helps the user)
4. Submit the rejection

Common rejection reasons:
- Scheduling conflict
- Insufficient information
- Room capacity mismatch
- Policy violation

::callout{icon="i-lucide-message-square" color="info"}
**Always provide a clear reason** when rejecting requests. This helps users understand what to change when resubmitting.

## Editing Requests

You can edit booking details before approving:

1. Click the edit icon on the booking
2. Modify necessary fields (time, room, etc.)
3. Save changes
4. Approve the modified booking

## Handling Recurring Requests

For recurring booking requests:

- Review all generated dates for conflicts
- Check that the recurring pattern makes sense
- Approve or reject the entire series
- Edit individual instances if needed

::callout{icon="i-lucide-alert-triangle" color="warning"}
Be extra careful with recurring bookings as they reserve the room for multiple dates. Check the entire date range for conflicts.
