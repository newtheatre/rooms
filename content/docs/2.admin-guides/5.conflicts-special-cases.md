Learn how to effectively resolve booking conflicts and manage special circumstances that may arise.

## Booking Conflicts

### Identifying Conflicts

The system automatically detects conflicts when:
- Two bookings overlap in time for the same room
- A recurring booking conflicts with existing reservations
- Last-minute changes create scheduling issues

### Resolving Conflicts

When a conflict arises:

1. **Review Both Bookings**: Check details of conflicting reservations
2. **Assess Priority**: Consider factors like:
   - Booking creation date (first come, first served)
   - Event importance or type
   - Flexibility of each party
   - Organizational policies

3. **Contact Users**: Reach out to users to:
   - Explain the conflict
   - Discuss alternative times or rooms
   - Find a mutually acceptable solution

4. **Make Changes**: 
   - Modify one or both bookings
   - Suggest alternative rooms
   - Adjust time slots

For unusually long bookings:

1. Verify the duration is necessary

4. Explain clearly to the user

### Series Modifications

When editing recurring bookings:

1. Determine if changes affect:
   - Single instance
