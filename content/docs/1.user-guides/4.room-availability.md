Learn how to effectively search for available rooms and understand the availability indicators in the system.

## Checking Availability

The system provides several ways to check if a room is available:

### Availability Badge

Each room displays an availability badge showing its current status:

- **Available**: The room is free for your selected time slot
- **Partially Available**: Some conflicts exist with your desired time
- **Unavailable**: The room is fully booked during your time slot

### Calendar View

Use the calendar view to:

- See all bookings across different rooms
- Identify time slots with availability
- Compare multiple venues side-by-side

## Search Filters

Narrow down your search using filters:

- **Date Range**: Select your event dates
- **Time Period**: Choose morning, afternoon, or evening
- **Venue Type**: Filter by room features or capacity
- **Capacity**: Find rooms that fit your group size

## Booking Conflicts

The system automatically checks for conflicts:

- **Time Overlap**: Detects if the room is already booked
- **Recurring Events**: Shows recurring booking patterns
- **Buffer Time**: Accounts for setup/cleanup time if configured
