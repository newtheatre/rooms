If you have a regular event that needs the same room weekly or monthly, you can create a recurring booking to reserve the space for multiple dates at once.

## When to Use Recurring Bookings

Recurring bookings are ideal for:

- Weekly meetings or classes
- Regular rehearsals or practice sessions
- Monthly gatherings
- Semester-long events

## Creating a Recurring Booking

When submitting a booking request:

1. Fill in the basic booking details (room, date, time)
2. Enable the "Recurring Event" option
3. Choose your recurrence pattern:
   - **Daily**: Every day
   - **Weekly**: Same day each week
   - **Monthly**: Same date each month (Coming Soon™)
4. Set the end date or number of occurrences
5. Review the generated dates
6. Submit for approval

## Managing Recurring Bookings

Once approved, you can:

- **Edit Single Instance**: Modify one occurrence without affecting others
- **Edit All Future**: Update this and all future occurrences (Coming Soon™)
- **Cancel Single Instance**: Remove one occurrence
- **Cancel Series**: Cancel the entire recurring series (Coming Soon™)
